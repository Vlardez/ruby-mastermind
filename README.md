## ruby-mastermind

An assignment - part of the Odin Project curriculum - that creates a command-line Mastermind game in Ruby.

# Program Description

The program will have the computer randomly select a secret code from a selection of colors.
The user must then guess the code within a certain number of turns. 

The basic implementation will have the user guess a 4-color code from 6 possible colors in 12 turns.

Afterwards, as further practice, I would like to set up the ability to choose a difficulty. 
The different difficulties will have more possible colors, a larger code, and/or fewer turns to guess. 

I would also like to setup the computer to be able to try to guess the code.
